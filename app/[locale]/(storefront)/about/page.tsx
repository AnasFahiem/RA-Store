                    We started with a simple mission: cut out the middleman. Most gym gear you buy is marked up 300% by big brands who don't touch a sewing machine.

                    We own the machines. We buy the raw leather and neoprene. We stitch every belt and glove.

                    By selling directly to you, we can offer professional grade equipment at prices the big brands can't touch.
